      <title>Search a Table in MySQL</title>

      <description>The CodeSELECT * FROM info WHERE Name LIKE &amp;lsquo;Keyword&amp;rsquo;; This way, you would get a &amp;lsquo;sort of search&amp;rsquo;, because you would have to type the name of the item 100% correctly, otherwise no results would show up. I guess this is sort of a &amp;lsquo;strict&amp;rsquo; search, if something is slightly wrong, nothing would be returned.</description>
