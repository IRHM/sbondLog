      <title>Scale on Hover CSS</title>

      <description>What Do You Mean?What I mean by &amp;lsquo;Scale On Hover&amp;rsquo; is that when you hover over an element on your page it will scale up. I like to use this when you have something that is clickable and you want to add some &amp;lsquo;smoothness&amp;rsquo; to it. It makes the whole page flow nicer if you use it correctly and you don&amp;rsquo;t go over the top with it.</description>

      <description>What?If you have some elements on your page that are causing a scrollbar to appear, but you would prefer them not to you can use some easy code in CSS to stop it from happening.
You can use this trick on the specific tag or you can disable the scrollbar fully by putting it in the body tag.</description>
