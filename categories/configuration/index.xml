      <description>What?As you may know, Homegroup was removed from Windows 10 and the new Network tab replaced it. It is essentially the same thing, you can share files between different PCs across your network. I use this tool a lot when sharing files between PCs and it is very useful, whilst working.</description>

      <description>What?If you have thousands or maybe just hundreds of empty lines in a text document you have, you may want to know how to remove all of the empty lines without having to manually do it.

      <description>What?Everyone knows about the old Snipping Tool that may have been used to screenshot certain things, to share or put in documents. There is now an easier to access tool which allows you to take screenshots quickly and then have them in your clipboard to paste somewhere.
