      <description>Step 1 - Add The ControlIn the toolbox search for &amp;ldquo;ToolTip&amp;rdquo; and plop it onto your form. It isn&amp;rsquo;t something you put directly on your form, but instead it will just sit at the bottom in a little box.

      <description>The CodeSELECT * FROM info WHERE Name LIKE &amp;#39;Keyword&amp;#39;; This way, you would get a &amp;lsquo;sort of search&amp;rsquo;, because you would have to type the name of the item 100% correctly, otherwise no results would show up. I guess this is sort of a &amp;lsquo;strict&amp;rsquo; search, if something is slightly wrong, nothing would be returned.</description>

You can use subdomains to redirect to a different server which can show different content, but in this post, you will learn how to make a subdomain redirect to a directory in your site.</description>

      <guid>https://log.sbond.ml/l/webdev/password-protect-directory-on-site/</guid>
      <description>What Will You Be Using?To properly protect your directories/files on your public web server you will want to use back-end password protection. Front-end protecting with using things like JavaScript will not be very protecting of your files because, someone who goes on your page could simply click F12 and change your code, so they can type in a password they want it to be.</description>

      <description>What?A subdomain looks something like this: wiki.sbond.ml
You will recognise one because it will have text before the actual domain, something like the www. you see before most sites. Luckily we have the .htaccess file because this all becomes a lot easier once you get into it.

      <description>How?One thing to note is that .htaccess files do not have a file type. So always make sure when you are making this file that there should never be a file extension beside it.
There are multiple ways of making this file and I&amp;rsquo;m going to be showing you two of them.</description>

      <description>What?This simple calculator program will allow the user to enter two ( or more if you wish ) numbers and then choose a method to use (+, -, /, *). We will use if statements.
How? Well, first we need to add 3 ( or more ) variables. The first two will be holding the user&amp;rsquo;s numbers and the third will be the method they want to use ( Both variables will be asking for the user&amp;rsquo;s input as well ).</description>

      <description>What?Everyone knows about the old Snipping Tool that may have been used to screenshot certain things, to share or put in documents. There is now an easier to access tool which allows you to take screenshots quickly and then have them in your clipboard to paste somewhere.
It is honestly kind of a shame they didn&amp;rsquo;t add more features to the new screenshotting tool.</description>

      <description>What Do You Mean?What I mean by &amp;lsquo;Scale On Hover&amp;rsquo; is that when you hover over an element on your page it will scale up. I like to use this when you have something that is clickable and you want to add some &amp;lsquo;smoothness&amp;rsquo; to it. It makes the whole page flow nicer if you use it correctly and you don&amp;rsquo;t go over the top with it.</description>
