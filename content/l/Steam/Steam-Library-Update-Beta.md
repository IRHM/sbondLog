I definitley think that this is a step up from the previous UI, which is super
outdated, but there are a few things missing and I hope that they
aren't forgotten about when this is fully released.

{{< link-heading "Home Menu" >}}

The new home menu is pretty great, although it lacks customization. This is
quite a major flaw in my opinion, because not everyone wants to see the
'What's New' tab before 'Recent Games' or even see it at all.
They may just want the home screen to be filled with their games
(You have to scroll down a bit before this becomes the case).

You can remove updates by right clicking on them.

If you could move everything on the home page, people could have great
opportunities to change things to their likings, instead of being stuck with
what valve chose them.

Anyways, this is can be a great page for people that want to know
everything about the games they own.

</center>

They didn't completely disregard customization at least! You can add you own
custom shelves at the bottom (which can't be moved to the top of the home
screen).

{{< link-heading "Categorising Games" >}}

As you can see, on the left. Categories are being shown, even when nothing is
inside of them. It would be great if they were hidden until games were added
to the category.

If you want to only show games that are installed, you still can by clicking
the small play button at the top of your games list, this is still nice, but it
still shows the categories the games are in. You can turn off the categories by
clicking the Filtered List button at the top of your library and turning off the
'Group By Collection' tick box.

</center>

You can also filter through your games like above. ^ Notice the game updating
at the bottom, yeah that is a new animation and it is welcome!

The sidebar with all your games is not resizable on it's own. Being able to drag
the edge to make it bigger or smaller would be a great addition.

{{< link-heading "Collections" >}}

<center>
  <img src="https://ul.sbond.co/i/log/steam/lib/collections.png" />
</center>

The are basically just categories, but there is a nice new menu that shows them
in the grid mode. This is especially nice when you are digging through
you library to find a game you want to play.

  <img src="https://ul.sbond.co/i/log/steam/lib/collections-dynamic.png" />
</center>

There is an awesome new way you can make these Collections, they call them
Dynamic, and truthfully so. You can assign a store tag, genre or something else
to this collection and whenever you buy a new game that also has the same store
tag or anything else linked to the collection, it will automatically
add it to itself.

{{< link-heading "Game Menus" >}}

<center>
  <img src="https://ul.sbond.co/i/log/steam/lib/game-menu.png" />
</center>

I love that they are integrating friends activity, the games feed and other
info about the game all into one lovely looking menu. This will make it soo
much easier to find out what friends are doing & what updates have come out
for the game (these updates are shown at the top).

One thing that is missing, is the random screenshots that you have taken from
the game, appearing in the background. I take a lot of screenshots (12k), and
each screenshot for me reminds me of something that takes me back years when
me and the lads were having an awesome time. Definitely going to miss this if
it is gone forever.

{{< link-heading "Free Games" >}}

Usually when you have a free game, it will only show in your library when it is
currently installed on that PC, but I have noticed that F2P games are now just
in your library, even when they aren't installed.

{{< link-heading "TDLR;" >}}

This update is pretty awesome, and it will only get better when they get around
to update the rest of the UI. This will probably take a very long time,
considering this is only just in beta now & was talked about for a couple years.

It's looking pretty good right now, but I will probably stick to the stable
release for now until it is fully done, which hopefully won't be too long from
now.
