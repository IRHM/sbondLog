{{<link-heading "How?">}}

**One thing to note is that .htaccess files do not have a file type. Just make sure you dont end up with something like: .htaccess.txt**

Simply create a text document, open it up with any text editor then go to **file >> Save as**. When in the save as menu, click on **Save as** type, then change it to All types. Once it is changed to All types you can remove everything in the File name box and type in **.htaccess**. Do the same thing again, but instead make the **.htpassword**.

Once you have done one of the above methods to create your file, you are done!
