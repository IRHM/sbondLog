{{< link-heading "What?" >}}

Everyone knows about the old Snipping Tool that may have been used to screenshot certain things, to share or put in documents. There is now an easier to access tool which allows you to take screenshots quickly and then have them in your clipboard to paste somewhere.

It is honestly kind of a shame they didn't add more features to the new screenshotting tool. A screenshotting tool, in my opinion, is essential to have on your pc if you ever need to share something or save it for later.

It's really easy, just click **âŠž + Shift + S**, and then use your mouse and drag over the area you want screenshotted.
