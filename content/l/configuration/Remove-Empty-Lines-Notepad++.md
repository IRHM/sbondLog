If you have thousands or maybe just hundreds of empty lines in a text document you have, you may want to know how to remove all of the empty lines without having to manually do it.

To be clear I have used this in Notepad++, I am not sure if it would work anywhere else. If you have thousands of empty lines and your current notepad program doesn't have this feature, it is worth it to download Notepad++. To be fair Notepad++ is a great notepad program and I use it as my main one.
