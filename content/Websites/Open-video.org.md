This project is being worked on by a few people from the Interaction Design Laboratory at the School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.

This project is a website including over 3,000 videos. This isn't your usual 'Youtube Copy', but instead a site with the main goal being to build a giant database of informational videos.
